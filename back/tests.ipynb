Many of these n ew technologies have supported the development and realisati on of\\nsmart cities. In this study, the authors present an outline of  security for smart cities and provide a deeper understanding of w hat\\nwe meant by securing smart cities. They discuss the applicability of  existing security methods of authentication, access control,\\nencryption, firewalls, and their appropriateness to defending  a smart city. Specifically, we cover the security of data, intern et,\\nwater supply, electricity supply, city brain, and other critical city services and present the possible malicious attacks on a smart\\ncity and consequences. Finally, they discuss security best practices fo r smart cities.\\n1\\u0bd1Introduction\\nIt is undeniable that we are moving towards the era of smart cities.\\nCountries around the world are implementing smart cities, such as\\nthose in the UK, China, and Hong Kong. Smart cities, collectively,\\nis an area that overlaps information and communications\\ntechnology (ICT), urban sciences, environmental sciences, and\\nsocial sciences. This multi-disciplinary field, although complex in\\nits formation, is also exciting since it is going to transform the lives\\nof millions of city residents. Threats can be viewed as attempts to\\nattack a target in many forms, be it on data, access, control,\\nservices, connectivity etc. Threat prevention is always a\\nrequirement and a challenge for smart cities. Many have debated\\nwhat is an effective ‘FIREWALL’ or ‘SHIELD’ for securing smart\\ncities. There is also a lack of focus on cyber-security for smart\\ncities [1, 2]. In this study, we intend to discuss this.\\n2\\u0bd1Understanding smart cities2.1 Human versus city analogy\\nThere are some resembles between humans and cities. People live\\nand work in cities. A city's vibrancy is tied to its business\\noperations and citizens’ activities. If we look at what makes up a\\nhuman, it is the brain, senses, and body. A human brain is the\\ncentre of intelligence, where reasoning and decisions are made and\\nwere information is processed and stored. Our human senses\\n(through the eye, ear, nose, skin etc.) allow us to gather\\ninformation and send them to the brain for processing. Finally, the\\nhuman body provides all the other necessary functions to sustain\\nliveability. Likewise, we can view a smart city has having a simi lar\\nform of construction as that of a human being.\\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the three building blocks of a smart city are\\nas follows: \\n(a) Brain  – the centre of control and decision-making authority of a\\nsmart city. It is the central command centre, where observations are\\nanalysed, abnormalities are monitored and detected, and events are\\ntriggered.\\nFig. 1\\u0bd2  Analogy of a human versus a smart city\\n \\nIET Smart Cities , 2020, Vol. 2 Iss. 2, pp. 95-104\\nThis is an open access article published by the IET under the C reative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License\\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)95\\n(b) Senses  – the inputs to the smart city systems include: vision,\\nsound, sensor readings etc. Vision takes the form of cameras\\nlocated at specific sites. Microphones can be used to record the\\nconversation of crime scenes (and other used cases) to serve as\\nevent trigger points and evidence. For example, water flow gauges\\ncan be used to detect floods while smart meters can be used to\\nrecord electricity and water usage.\\n(c) Body  – the body of a smart city system refers to both\\ninfrastructures and ICT platforms. By infrastructures, we refer to\\nbuildings, roads, drains etc. By ICT, we refer to three platforms: (a)\\nconnectivity, (b) data, and (c) artificial intelligence (AI).\\n2.2 System architecture\\nFrom an ICT point of view, a smart city has four essential layers:\\n(a) sensors or end points, (b) edges (gateways), (c) platform (data,\\nAI, connectivity management), and (d) applications, i.e.\\nSMART CITY = sensors +edge +platform +\\napplications\\nFrom a higher level of abstraction, a smart city is analogous to a\\nliving thing (after all it is indispensable without the Internet of\\nThings (IoT)) [3]. Alibaba has viewed a smart city as having a ‘city\\nbrain’ [4], where the bulk of AI resides, so as to govern the\\nactivities and control of all things (internal and external). Huawei\\n[5] has even coined the term ‘smart city nerve system’ to depict the\\nexistence of sensing and intelligence.\\nFor a smart city, it is expected that IoT will be an indispensable\\npart of the whole city platform. The ‘inputs’ to the smart city\\nsystem will be sensors, be it video cameras, microphones,\\ntemperature sensors, water gauges etc. Sensors are devices that will\\ninteract with the physical world, collect data, and relay them back\\nto the collection points over different wired (optical fibre, wires\\netc.) or wireless (WiFi, Bluetooth, narrowband-IoT etc.) links. The\\ncollection points are commonly termed as gateways. Sensors\\ncommonly use the message queuing telemetry transport or\\nconstrained application protocol messaging protocol to send data\\nover wireless links to the gateway. The messages are usually small\\nsize packets and are light weight in order to conserve power\\nconsumption by the sensors in transmitting these data. Smart city\\napplications residing on the cloud platform can interact with the\\ngateway via the standard REST API.\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, a smart city's system architecture is viewed\\nto contain four horizontal layers and two vertical layers, with\\napplications residing on top. The essential four horizontal layers\\nare device and sensing layers, followed by connectivity, IoT\\nmanagement, and data-AI layers. The first layer concerns sensors\\nand other devices (cameras etc.) that provide inputs to the smart\\ncity system. Sensor data are then connected to collection points\\n(gateways) via the connectivity layer. The IoT connection\\nmanagement layer residing on the edge provides a collection ofdifferent sensor data sent over different links and different\\nprotocols, ensuring interoperability across heterogeneous devices\\nand connectivity. Finally, the data-AI layer provides data\\nprocessing, analytics, insights, and intelligence to drive smart city\\napplications.\\nAt the upper layer, different smart city applications will utilise\\ndata and insights differently, and they will trigger appropriate\\nevents to occur (e.g. summoning the police to the crime scene for a\\nsmart city security application). AI technology can be used to help\\nanalyse the data and predict the correct output (such as facial\\nrecognition to identify the criminal under investigation). Hence, the\\ndata and processing layers are present in each smart city\\napplication. Ideally, one common data and AI platform layer can be\\npresent to serve all possible smart city applications but realistical ly,\\nthis is hard to achieve given the fact that there exist different\\nadministrative control domains (where one transport domain may\\nnot allow another say health domain access and sharing of data)\\nand a centralised platform layer can result in a bottleneck at times\\nof failures.\\nThe vertical layers of the architecture concern security,\\noperations, and control management. Since some smart city\\napplications are developed for private parties, such as a private\\nhome estate or a private business building, they are considered\\nsilos on their own, with little or no requirement to interface to other\\nsmart city applications. However, certain smart city applications\\n(e.g. smart transport, health, and environment) are serving the\\npublic and are established by the government and hence, these\\npublic smart city applications will require\\n(a) Operations and control management\\n(b) Applications interconnection and interoperability\\n(c) Comprehensive security\\nThe Intelligent Operations Center (IOC) [6] or the Command and\\nControl Center, for example, is an entity that allows the\\ngovernment to control its various smart city subsystems (transport,\\nenvironment, public security etc.) centrally. This design will also\\nallow the interconnection and interaction of various government\\nsmart city applications. For example, in the case of a crime\\nhappening at a road junction, the police will need access to smart\\ntransport, smart intersection, and smart lamp posts applications in\\norder to gather all related data associated with the crime. It must\\nalso be able to control the cameras near or located at the crime\\nscene. Hence, for government-hosted smart city applications, there\\nis a need for these applications to interface and interact with one\\nother, and allow for the exchange of relevant data.\\nA smart city system and its applications need to be secured and\\nsecurity features have to be built into each layer of the smart city\\nplatform, end-to-end, so as to ensure integrity, prevent intrusion\\nand malicious attacks. This explains why security cuts across all\\nhorizontal layers. Devices need to be secured to ensure they are\\ntamper proof. Sensor data transmitted over a secured wired or\\nFig. 2\\u0bd2  Proposed smart city system architecture, where security and city management cut acros s all layers\\n \\n96 IET Smart Cities , 2020, Vol. 2 Iss. 2, pp. 95-104\\nThis is an open access article published by the IET under the C reative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License\\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)\\n 26317680, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-smc.2020.0001 by CAPES, Wiley Online Library on [06/11/2024].

Only authorised personnel\\nshould be granted access to devices, either locally or remotely.\\nData should be securely stored in distributed storage. Access to\\ndata should be granted to authorised applications and personnel.\\nData associated with each smart city application can be regarded as\\na standalone entity, securely stored in private or public cloud. They\\ncan be shared or kept secret. Many countries have established\\npolicies associated with data governance and depending on the\\nlocation where data are kept, authorities have jurisdiction over the\\ndata and its misuse. We shall examine security for smart cities in\\ngreater depth in the next section.\\n3\\u0bd1Security for smart cities\\n3.1 How to view the security problem?\\nSecurity for smart cities refers to a bigger problem, and one should\\nnot view it in silos. By silos, we are referring to developing\\nsecurity solutions for specific smart city applications, such as smart\\ntransport, smart health, smart environment, smart living etc.\\nRather, one should view and understand what are the underlying\\nfactors that will govern and contribute to the secured operations\\nand services of these smart city applications.\\nEffectively, we need to secure the ‘brain’, ‘body’, and ‘senses’\\nof a smart city, in addition to securing each smart city application.\\nThis calls for a comprehensive and total security solution to protect\\na smart city. As shown in Fig. 3, the security solution will not only\\nshield and protect the city from attackers from intruders outside the\\ncity but also protect its internals – infrastructures, connectivity,\\napplications, and services. 3.2 What is there to secure?\\nIn designing security solutions for smart cities, one needs to\\nexamine: (a) what is there to protect, (b) what are the end goals of\\nthe attackers, and (c) the types of attacks. To understand what is\\nthere to protect in a smart city, we need to look at its assets. A\\nsmart city's assets are its resources, people, and services. By\\nresources, I am referring to \\n(a) financial assets – monies, commodities (gold etc.), other assets\\n(stocks etc.),\\n(b) infrastructures – telecommunications, internet, data centres,\\noffices, homes, etc. and\\n(c) life essentials – water, electricity, food, medical supplies etc .\\n(Fig. 4).\\nBy people, I am referring to the humans who live and work in the\\ncity. This includes both young and old. People form the talent pool\\nand workforce of a city, and they support the business operations\\nand drive the city's economy. Finally, by city services, I am\\nreferring to public health, water and electricity supply, public\\nsanitary, sewage services, police, ambulance services etc.\\nAll of these are important assets for a smart city. Attackers can\\nbe tempted to strike due to a city's wealth or its richness in\\nresources, prompting them to steal such assets. However, not all\\nattackers are lured to theft. Other end goals include attackers who\\nare more interested to create chaos by disrupting or halting\\nservices. Also, most attacks are malicious and they generally fall\\ninto the following two categories:\\n(a) Attacks that disrupt the lives of city residents\\n(b) Attacks that disrupt business operations in the city\\nBoth of these end goals are traumatic to the lives and economic\\nwell-being of a city. Also, the type of attacks can be defined by the\\nlocality\\nLocal attacks – physical presence at the site or vicinity of the\\nattack. This is where command centres with video surveillance\\nhelp to capture attackers and identify them.\\nRemote attacks – away from the site but using internet connectivity\\nto gain control of computer systems to disrupt city services. These\\nattackers are usually residing outside the city and will need to be\\nhunt down through their internet protocol (IP) network addresses.\\nWithout losing focus, one should identify which are the more\\ncritical resources and services compared to others. Critical\\nresources and services are those essential for day-to-day normal\\noperations of the city that support citizens’ lives and business\\noperations. With this in mind, the following six most critical\\nresources and services to protect have been identified and are\\nshown in Tables 1 and 2. In the next few sections, security aspects\\nassociated with each of these critical resources and services will be\\nelaborated.\\n3.3 Securing water supply\\nAn essential element for human survival is water, which is why it\\nis highest in priority. A city cannot continue its normal life without\\nthe presence of water, both for personal consumption and\\nbusinesses (in restaurants etc.). Attacks on water source point and\\nwater transport can disrupt water supplies. Again, such attacks can\\nbe done physically by the attackers on site, shutting off power\\nFig. 3\\u0bd2  Security protection shield of a smart city is equivalent to having\\nmulti-layers of security protection, from protecting the brain to the se nses\\nand body\\n \\nFig. 4\\u0bd2  Three assets of a smart city\\n(a) People, (b) Resources, (c) Services.

Through cyberspace,\\nthey gain control over the water management system to shut down\\nor reduce water supply to the city. Watchdogs programmes have to\\nbe present 24\\u2009×\\u20097 to constantly monitor for anomalies and remote\\naccess to the water management system should be restricted to a\\nhand few or even forbidden.\\nAccording to [7], water contamination is a critical event to be\\nprevented. Terrorists can resort to poisoning the drinking water\\nreservoir to infect millions of people quickly, resulting in sickness\\nor death. In the USA, the Bioterrorism Act (2002) [8] is a legal\\nframework and action to address this issue. The Bioterrorism Act\\nrequires that drinking water utilities that serve more than 3300\\npeople to conduct vulnerability assessments and develop\\nemergency response plans. As shown in Fig. 5, by tampering with\\nany part of the water treatment and supply process, one can infect\\nwater supply with chemical hazards. \\n3.4 Securing energy\\nMost of the smart cities applications today are powered by\\nelectricity. Without power, most of the smart city system and\\nbusiness will cease to operate and the city left in darkness. Hence,\\nsecuring power source and power delivery is critical to smart cities.\\nPower generation can be halt by physically destroying the site, or\\ninterrupting the electricity generation process. This demandsstringent site security to ensure power generation will not be\\ninterrupted, and there exists backup power in times of interruption.\\nPower delivery [9], however, refers to power relayed through\\npower lines, transformers, relays, switches, and power stations.\\nHence, attacks on any of these components can interrupt power\\nsupply, crippling all smart city applications. In fact, it has been\\nreported that terrorists [10] were targeting energy generation sites\\nas possible places to attack in order to create massive city\\nblackouts and potentially driving street riots. It is important that a\\ncomprehensive strategy and framework be established in order to\\nsecure both power generation and power delivery to the city\\n(Fig. 6). \\nFurthermore, since an energy infrastructure system is highly\\nnetworked, there exists a chance for a cascade of disruptions,\\nthereby multiplying the impact of a single localised attack. This\\ncan result in massive blackouts in multiple cities. Smart cities must\\nhave built-in robustness and isolation capability to counter such\\nattacks.\\n3.5 Securing connectivity\\nSmart city infrastructures require connectivity to connect sensors,\\ncameras, data centres etc. Hence, connectivity is the other\\nbloodline (in addition to power) for smart cities. Connectivity can\\noccur over wired and wireless network infrastructures. This could\\nalso be viewed as securing IoT. IoT security includes device, data,\\nand connection security. In [12], device security includes hardware\\nsecurity (tamper proof), access and authentication control. Data\\nsecurity is achieved by encryption while connection security is\\nattained by using light weight secured end-to-end transport\\nprotocols.\\nExisting telecom networks used to support fixed broadband and\\nmobile cellular networks are reasonably secured, with few\\nincidents of connectivity hijacking. However, for a smart city, the\\nsecurity requirements should be raised higher since people expect a\\nsmart city to be more secured than normal cities. Table 3 presents a\\nlist of security protection methods for different types of wireless\\nlinks, which will be discussed below. \\nWiFi security : securing wireless networks requires securing the\\nwireless link. It requires a secured media access control (MAC)\\nprotocol where access to the link will be controlled. In WiFi, WiFi\\nprotected access (WPA) was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to\\nprovide more sophisticated data encryption capability and better\\nuser authentication than wired equivalent privacy (WEP), which\\nwas the original Wi-Fi security standard.\\nBluetooth security : Bluetooth [13] offers several security\\nmodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and device manufacturers determine which mode\\nto include in a Bluetooth-enabled gadget. In almost all cases,\\nBluetooth users can establish ‘trusted devices’ that can exchange\\nFig. 5\\u0bd2  Water supply involves water treatment prior to delivery on a tap (source: https://www.compoundchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Water-\\nTreatment-Process.pdf)\\n \\nFig. 6\\u0bd2  Power supply, transmission, and distribution network [11]\\n \\n98 IET Smart Cities , 2020, Vol. 2 Iss. 2, pp. 95-104\\nThis is an open access article published by the IET under the C reative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License\\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)\\n 26317680, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-smc.2020.0001 by CAPES, Wiley Online Library on [06/11/2024].

When any other device tries to\\nestablish a connection to the user's gadget, the user has to decide\\nwhether to allow it. Service-level security and device-level security\\nwork together to protect Bluetooth devices from unauthorised data\\ntransmission. Security methods include authorisation and\\nidentification procedures that limit the use of Bluetooth services to\\nthe registered user and require users to make a conscious decision\\nwhen opening a file or accepting a data transfer. As long as these\\nmeasures are enabled on the user's phone or other devices,\\nunauthorised access is unlikely to occur. A user can also simply\\nswitch his Bluetooth mode to ‘non-discoverable’ and, therefore,\\navoid connecting with other unsafe Bluetooth devices entirely.\\nLORAWAN security : the LoRaWAN security design adheres to\\nstate-of-the-art principles: the use of standard, well-vetted\\nalgorithms, and end-to-end security. LoRaWAN security include:\\n(a) mutual authentication, (b) integrity protection, and (c)\\nconfidentiality. Mutual authentication is established between a\\nLoRaWAN end-device and the LoRaWAN network as part of the\\nnetwork join procedure. This ensures that only genuine and\\nauthorised devices will be joined to genuine and authentic\\nnetworks. LoRaWAN MAC and application messaging are origin\\nauthenticated, integrity protected, replay protected, and encrypted.\\nThis protection, combined with mutual authentication, ensures that\\nnetwork traffic has not been altered, is coming from a legitimate\\ndevice, is not comprehensible to eavesdroppers and has not been\\ncaptured and replayed by rogue actors. LoRaWAN security further\\nimplements end-to-end encryption for application payloads\\nexchanged between the end-devices and application servers.\\nLoRaWAN security uses the advanced encryption standard (AES)\\ncryptographic primitive combined with several modes of operation:CMAC2 [14] for integrity protection and CTR3 [15] for\\nencryption. Each LoRaWAN device is personalised with a unique\\n128-bit AES key (called AppKey) and a globally unique identifier\\n(EUI-64-based DevEUI), both of which are used during the device\\nauthentication process.\\nSIGFox security : SIGFox [16] is a low-power low-cost solution\\nto connect sensors and devices. The radio communication between\\nthe base stations and the SIGFox cloud, as well as the SIGFox\\ncloud itself, are secured using signature-based authentication and\\nvirtual private network (VPN). Users are connected to the SIGFox\\ncloud using the hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)\\nencrypted interfaces. SIGFox has a built-in firewall that prohibits\\ninternet access to SIGFox devices without going through SIGFox\\ncore network and data are protected both in transit and at rest.\\nData-in-motion security is achieved through message\\nauthentication and replay avoidance. Through the use of a message\\ntoken and an authentication key, verification of the token ensures\\nthe authentication of the sender and the integrity of the message.\\nFor data at rest security, SIGFox base stations and its core network\\nuse trusted platform module, also known as ISO/IEC 11889, to\\nsecure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys.\\nLong-term evolution (LTE) security : LTE is the key 4G cellular\\ntechnology that is globally used today to support broadband mobile\\ncellular communications. Concerning security, the USA National\\nInstitute of Science and Technology (NIST) organisation has\\npublished a comprehensive report on LTE Security [17], which\\ncovers: (a) hardware security, (b) cryptography, (c) air interface\\nsecurity, (d) E-UTRAN security, (e) backhaul security, and (d)\\ncore-network security. LTE infrastructure components (e.g. evolved\\nnode B, mobility management entity, serving gateway) may use\\ncommodity hardware, firmware, and software, making it\\nsusceptible to publicly known software flaws. Threats directed at\\nLTE networks include:\\n• Malware attacks\\n• Air interface eavesdropping\\n• Radio jamming\\n• Physical attacks on infrastructures\\nSecuring wired networks will also require securing the wired link.\\nMost wired connections occur over Ethernet, over co-axial cables\\nor fibres. There is nothing stopping someone from tapping on a\\nwired link to look at on-going waveforms and trying to extract\\ndata, but with signals encrypted, extraction is difficult.\\nProtocol security : in addition to ‘link security’, there is also a\\nneed for security embedded into the protocol, i.e. ‘protocol\\nsecurity’. Most internet data communications over wired or\\nwireless links use the transmission control protocol/user datagram\\nprotocol/IP suite. Internet access and service provision are key to\\nmany home and business users. Disruption in the provision of\\ninternet services can shutdown many business operations etc.\\nTable 4 presents a list of security enabled protocols to provide\\nnetwork and end-point security. \\n3.6 Securing data\\nMost smart city applications will sense, collect, process, and\\nanalyse data to yield meaning insights and using these insights to\\ncreate meaning services. For example, smart-transport applications\\nwill collect vehicular-, driver-, traffic-, and passenger-data while\\nsmart-health applications will collect patient- and doctor-data.\\nRegardless of which smart city applications, data will be generated\\nas part of the smart city platform and these need to be secured, both\\nin content and in storage. Such data can be protected in several\\nways:\\n(a) Access control – denying unauthorised access to the data.\\n(b) Encryption – protect the content of the data.\\n(c) Authentication – authenticate the source.\\n(d) Signatures – confirm the validity of the data.\\n(e) Privacy – disassociate data from the identify and location of the\\nuser.Table 3 \\u2003List of wireless links and corresponding security\\nprotection methods\\nType of wireless\\nlinksSecurity protection methods\\n• WiFi WEP and WPA\\n• Bluetooth authentication; confidentiality; authorisation\\n[13]\\n• LORA See [14, 15]\\n• SIGFOX firewall; anti-eavesdropping; authentication;\\nreplay avoidance.

All these have caused a public outcry\\nand the call for government action. Therefore, for a smart city, one\\nneeds to look at protecting the various types of data associated with\\neach smart city application and held the respective entity\\nresponsible and accountable to, as shown in Tables 5 and 6.\\nFrom Table 6, a large bulk of data is under the responsibility of\\nthe government. Hence, governments should establish\\ncomprehensive policies and frameworks to protect data. For\\nexample, in the USA, the Department of Commerce and justice\\ncourt have fined Yahoo Inc. for the data breach. Providers from\\nprivate institutions should also ensure their methods of protecting\\ncustomers' data indeed fulfil tough requirements. Regulations,\\nstandards, and best practices for protecting data are still evolving\\nand so far, no global standard has emerged.\\nIn the European Union (EU), the General Data Protection\\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 (‘GDPR’) [22] is introduced, covering\\ndata protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and\\nthe European Economic Area (EEA). It also concerns the export of\\npersonal data outside the EU and EEA. The European\\nCommission's Data Protection Directive [23] was adopted by the\\nEuropean Parliament and ministers from national governments in\\n1995. The directive contains key principles with which member\\nstates must comply. In the processing of personal data, one must\\ncomply with eight enforceable principles of good practices.

Laws and regulations are needed to ensure compliance\\nby organisations in possession of and responsible for the\\nprocessing of data.\\n3.7 Securing the smart city brain\\nA smart city system needs to be secured and accessed only by\\nauthorised personnel. Protecting access to devices, networks, and\\nplatforms is crucial in securing smart cities. Many cities around the\\nworld have used a centralised smart city operation and control\\ncentre concept.\\nHuawei, for example, has created the IOC – intelligence\\noperation centre [6], to perform smart city monitoring, control, and\\nresponse function, supported by real-time image capture, live video\\nfeeds, maps with live status information and updates on roads,\\npeople movement etc. This is illustrated by Fig. 7. \\nThe IOC must be fully secured. Gaining access and control over\\na smart city's IOC is regarded as a catastrophic event similar to tha t\\nof an invasion of the city and that needs to be quickly isolated. The\\nIOC must be swiftly repossessed by the authorities. Security issues\\nassociated with an IOC include the following:\\n• Issue of a compromised insider: this is often hard to detect as the\\nattacker is an under-cover authorised personnel.\\n• Issue of remote hack: people who have remote access rights to\\nthe IOC must be limited to no more than a handful in order to\\nnarrow down the culprits should an attack is made remotely.\\n• Stolen passwords: access passwords of authorised personnel at\\nthe IOC site may be stolen by malware and phishing techniques.\\nTo deal with this type of weakness, multi-factor access control\\ncan help narrow down and prevent intruders.\\n• Operational misbehaviours: IOC must have the ability to\\nmonitor and track operation misbehaviours by IOC staff. All\\nevents triggered at the IOC are monitored in real-time and\\nlogged into data storage for subsequent follow up and\\ninvestigations.\\n• Backup and takeover control: if an IOC is invaded, it has to be\\nquickly disabled. With replication of another IOC, the\\ncompromised IOC can be disabled by the other, rendering it\\nuseless. The disablement can be done in the form of cutting off\\nthe power to the IOC or disabling its connections to compute,\\nstorage, network, sensors, and all external interfaces. A master–\\nslave mode can also be established so that the compromised IOC\\nis made a slave (hence obeying the master IOC), with the master\\ncapable of disabling the slave IOC functions completely.\\n3.8 Securing smart city financial assets\\nFinancial assets include both tangible and intangible assets from\\ncity residents, business corporations, and government. Most of\\nthese financial assets are held by financial institutions, be it banks,\\nsecurities firms or credit unions. Possible attacks includeTable 5 \\u2003List of data to secure in a smart city\\nTypes of data to secure Remarks\\ntransport • aviation travel records\\n• land transport data\\n• driver data\\n• vehicle data\\n• trains, buses, taxis, etc.\\n• traffic lights\\nhealth • patient records\\n• doctor records\\n• medical supplies records\\n• medical staffs’ information\\nfinance • personal financial data\\n• business financial data\\n• tax data\\nutility • water usage\\n• electricity usage\\n• gas usage\\n• users (consumers) data\\ntelecom • subscribers’ data\\n• infrastructure data\\n• utilisation data\\n• transactions data\\n \\nTable 6 \\u2003A list of critical data to protect and the responsible\\nentities in a smart city\\nTypes of data Responsible entity\\n• citizens’ data • government\\n• financial data • financial institutions\\n• urban data • government\\n• utilities data • providers and government\\n• transport data • government\\n• health data • healthcare providers and government\\n• weather data • government\\n• criminal data • law-enforcers and government\\n• housing data • government\\n \\n100 IET Smart Cities , 2020, Vol. 2 Iss. 2, pp. 95-104\\nThis is an open access article published by the IET under the C reative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License\\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)\\n 26317680, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-smc.2020.0001 by CAPES, Wiley Online Library on [06/11/2024].

This is a major catastrophic\\nevent. Table 7 shows a list of possible attacks and the effects as a\\nresult of disrupting several types of critical services. \\nDisrupting law enforcement (police) and fire rescue operations\\nis also fatal. Furthermore, disruption of transport services (trains,\\nbuses, taxis, flights) and traffic lights are also disastrous (misuse of\\ntraffic lights can result in accidents and congestion). Disruption to\\nessential city services is considered a crime and an act of terrorism\\nin many countries nowadays. A smart city must, therefore, secure\\nall of its essential services. Attacks on a smart city's critic al\\nservices can take the form of\\n(a) Denial of service – totally stopping the provision of essential\\ncity services.\\n(b) Disrupting services – intermittent availability of city services.\\n3.10 Blockchain and smart cities\\nThe beauty of blockchain technology lies in its use of public-key\\nencryption and consensus protocols to validate transactions and\\nauthenticate a ledger in a distributed manner, without the need for a\\ncentralised authority. Since the roll out of bitcoin and the use of\\nblockchain technology, many people have accepted the use of\\nblockchain to provide security for financial transactions. Its\\nincorruptible distributed ledger technology has allowed bitcoin to\\nevolve as a digital cryptocurrency invested by millions. However,\\nhow can blockchain be applied to smart cities? Can blockchain be\\nused to make cities more efficient, transparent, secure, and\\nresilient? These are tough questions awaiting to be answered\\n(Table 8). \\nCurrently, blockchain is being used in smart contracts [27] –\\nwhere multiple parties (seller and buyer) can securely establish\\nbusiness agreements.

Smart\\ncontracts also allow credible transactions to be made without the\\nneed for third parties.\\nEstonia [28] has been using distributed ledger technology since\\n2012 in areas such as healthcare, judicial/legislative services,\\npersonal data, ID management, and more. Dubai [29] will apply\\nblockchain to city-wide logistics and storage industries, as well as\\nshifting to a 100% paperless government and storage system.\\nSeveral possible applications of blockchain to smart cities have\\nbeen suggested [30]. They include \\n• Identity – the decentralised identity management system can\\nprovide a secured mechanism for storing and validating user\\nidentities. This reduces identity thefts and other frauds.\\n• Payment – municipal city services payment can be made\\nthrough a blockchain payment platform.\\n• Energy – facilitate a resilient power grid by providing a secured\\nplatform for energy providers, buyers, and traders.\\n• Transport – facilitate a secured peer-to-peer transport platform\\nfor share ride users and providers.\\n• Waste management – the process of waste clearance and\\ntransportation can be managed over a distributed ledger, to\\nenable organised tracking of schedules and tasks.• Government services – the use of smart contracts for managing\\ncitizens' rights, votes, taxes, asset management etc. In Estonia,\\nE-Residency [28] allows the use of a digital ID to digitally sign\\ndocuments and contracts and the verification of the authenticity\\nof such documents.\\n• Insurance – blockchain can potentially disrupt the insurance\\nindustries [32] by the use of automated verification of claims\\nand payments data from third parties, thereby reducing\\nadministrative costs.\\n• Healthcare – health records use blockchain technology to secure\\ntheir content and prevents unauthorised changes to personal\\nhealth data (Fig. 8).\\n3.11 Security best practices\\nAccording to the EU Agency for Network and Information\\nSecurity [33], a list of best practices for cybersecurity protection of\\n[34] smart cities has been identified. They are:\\n• Use of VPNs\\n• Encryption of data\\n• Use of network intrusion detection system\\n• Use of physical protection\\n• Install access control\\n• Install alarms and surveillance\\n• Implement security policy\\n• Creation of activity logs\\n• Maintenance of backups\\n• Regular auditing\\n• Shutdown procedures\\nIntroducing best practices is a good approach for many countries to\\nimplement and learn from each other experiences. Every smart city\\nshould contribute to the definition of security best practices, report\\nand share every vulnerability so that such incidents will not happen\\nagain in other cities. In addition to the efforts made by the\\nEuropean ENISA, the American NIST addresses these issues by\\nintroducing a cybersecurity framework [35], as shown in Fig. 9. \\nThe prime purpose of the framework is to develop a common\\nlanguage for better understanding and interpretations of\\ncybersecurity risks to stakeholders. The framework introduces five\\nmain core functions as\\n(a) Identify – to develop an understanding of the cybersecurity\\nrisks associated with people, systems, assets, data, and capabilities.\\n(b) Protect – to develop safeguard measures to limit and contain a\\nsecurity event while protecting and ensuring the delivery of\\nservices.\\n(c) Detect – to develop methods to identify security beaches and\\nanomalies.\\n(d) Respond – to react to an event by containing it, limiting its\\nharmful impact.\\n(e) Recovery – to quickly restore capabilities and services impaired\\nby the security event and prevent further similar attacks.\\nA well-defined management process is used in the evaluation,\\nstrategic planning, operation and implementation of security\\nfunctions, especially for municipal city projects.\\nSince most smart city projects are huge, a well-defined\\nmanagement process is necessary. As shown in Fig. 10, to\\nsuccessfully secure a smart city, one would need to integrate\\nrecommended security standards [36], frameworks [37], policies,\\nbest practices, and learn the experiences from others. It has to be a\\ncontinual fine-tuning process so that most security issues can be\\naddressed. This means that smart cities in different countries must\\nbe willing to openly share their experiences and provide feedback\\nto facilitate the realisation of complete city protection – a process\\nthat will require the co-ordination of the International\\nTelecommunication Union and country government leaders.Table 8 \\u2003Global blockchain initiatives (source PWC [12])\\nCountry Remarks on the application of blockchain\\nSweden real estate transactions are made using blockchain\\nUK blockchains are used in the distribution of grants\\nEstonia blockchain helps to maintain transparency in medical\\nrecords\\nGhana blockchain used to provide tamper-resistant property\\nownerships\\nRussia blockchain used to provide secured trading and\\ntransactions between shareholders\\nKorea banks have created blockchain-based eco-system\\nSingapore blockchain used to help prevent trade invoice fraud\\n \\nFig. 8\\u0bd2  Estonian digital identity card (source [31])\\n \\nFig. 9\\u0bd2  NIST cybersecurity framework core functions and management\\n \\n102 IET Smart Cities , 2020, Vol. 2 Iss. 2, pp. 95-104\\nThis is an open access article published by the IET under the C reative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License\\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)\\n 26317680, 2020, 2, Downloaded from https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-smc.2020.0001 by CAPES, Wiley Online Library on [06/11/2024].

Also, many retail, enterprise, and passport control gate\\nentry systems around the world have increasingly deployed facial\\nrecognition technology to scan and validate travellers, visitors,\\nshoppers, and authorised personnel. Such increase reliance can\\nresult in a negative effect, where fraudsters will impersonate others\\nto hide their identities while committing crimes in public or private\\nplaces. In fact, there are already several cases where fraud using\\nsilicone masks (see Fig. 11) has resulted in millions of financial\\nlost (see Table 9). An important aspect of security for future smart\\ncities is to validate persons beyond mere facial recognition, by\\nusing biometrics, iris recognition, finger prints, voice, handwriting\\netc. This opens room for further research.\\n4\\u0bd1Conclusion\\nSmart cities’ developments have begun around the world and have\\npresented great challenges to industries and government. A smart\\ncity is incomplete without a comprehensive security framework\\nand mechanisms to protect its citizens, businesses, operations, and\\nservices. This study highlights the importance of security for a\\nsmart city and presents a list of possible attacks and identifies area s\\nto secure and protect, such as (a) water, (b) energy, (c) data, (d)\\nconnectivity (internet), (e) city brain, and (f) critical city services\\n(police, fire, banks, healthcare, and transport). Security for smartcities is an emerging topic of importance that requires deeper and\\nfurther research, and the problem should be viewed as security for\\na system of systems, from devices to applications, and from\\nproviders to users.\\n5\\u0bd1References\\n[1] Cybersecurity in smart cities.

    "A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.\n",
    "Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared \"I do\" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other.\n",
    "In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her \"first and only\" marriage.\n",
    "Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of \"offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,\" referring to her false statements on the\n",
    "2010 marriage license application, according to court documents.\n",
    "Prosecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam.\n",
    "On Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further.\n",
    "After leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said Detective\n",
    "Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.\n",
    "All occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx. She is believed to still be married to four men, and at one time, she was married to eight men at once, prosecutors say.\n",
    "Prosecutors said the immigration scam involved some of her husbands, who filed for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages.\n",
    "Any divorces happened only after such filings were approved. It was unclear whether any of the men will be prosecuted.\n",
    "The case was referred to the Bronx District Attorney\\'s Office by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security\\'s\n",
    "Investigation Division. Seven of the men are from so-called \"red-flagged\" countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Georgia, Pakistan and Mali.\n",
    "Her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, was deported in 2006 to his native Pakistan after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n",
    "If convicted, Barrientos faces up to four years in prison.  Her next court appearance is scheduled for May 18.\n",
